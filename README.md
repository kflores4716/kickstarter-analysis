# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louise’s play Fever has reached its fundraising goal but is still in the Kickstarter phase. She is looking to gather more insight into similar Kickstarter Campaigns to determine what led to their success (or failure). 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze multiple Theater Kickstarter Campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. This insight will help her decide how to position her campaign launch to give herself the highest chance of success. Once launched, she will then have a better idea as to how likely her campaign is to succeed.
## Analysis and Challenges
The two analyses were created in Microsoft Excel using a larger data set containing several categories of Kickstarter Campaign information. The data was filtered down to display Theater campaigns based on two metrics: 
1. Outcomes Based on Launch Date
2. Outcomes Based on Goals
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
To determine the outcomes of these campaigns based on their launch date, I created a Pivot Table and accompanying Line Chart in a new Excel sheet. The first column of the table filters the campaigns based on the month of the year that they launched. I then referenced the “Parent Category” column from the larger data set and filtered those categories to only show theater campaigns. Once the table showed the grand total of the campaigns based on the month they launched, I further separated them to show the three possible campaign outcomes:
1. Successful
2. Failed
3. Canceled
