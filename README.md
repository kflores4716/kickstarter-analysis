# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
Louiseâ€™s play Fever has reached its fundraising goal but is still in the Kickstarter phase. She is looking to gather more insight into similar Kickstarter Campaigns to determine what led to their success (or failure). 
### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to analyze multiple Theater Kickstarter Campaigns based on their launch dates and funding goals. This insight will help her decide how to position her campaign launch to give herself the highest chance of success. Once launched, she will then have a better idea as to how likely her campaign is to succeed.
